						&emsp;&emsp; Amazon has become one of the most important players when it comes to online shopping. Starting from a book online marketplace it now proposes many categories of products ranging from electronics to clothes. Given this high diversity of products and most importantly the very wide offering of the website, Amazon has been particularly popular thanks to its community of users. This community provides a human-powered recommender system.

							As users we have experienced how influenced we are by such reviews. They are in a way the only filter that help us assess the quality of a product. How many times have we decided to buy a product rather than another because many people judged the first one to be inherently better than the second? That’s why we came to wonder how reliable were those reviews.

							&emsp;&emsp; By reliable we do not plan on detecting fake reviews. We are trying to detect what is called the Herding Effect. This effect is exactly what makes us choose a product according to what our peers have chosen. But also it means that when the previous buyers have reviewed a product it is likely that our review will be influenced by this latter. This is what we will try to investigate in this project by looking at how the first review of a book influences the following ones. 
						</p>

						<p class="title-sub edit-item edit-content text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
							We have decided to focus on Amazon books as those make a great product to study the Herding effect as they are often available in different editions which do not modify the content (or very slightly). Therefore as we will see in the "Natural Experiment" section, we will be able to find pairs of identical books with different first review to see how the following ones relate.

                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
                		&emsp;&emsp; Fortunately for us, in this study we have encountered what we call a “Natural Experiment”. A Natural Experiment in our case, refers simply to the fact that each subject/element concerned by this analysis (the pair of similar books for instance) have a specific first rating and that this first rating is <strong>determined by nature</strong> or by other factors outside the control of this study. We have indeed for each pair of similar books a pseudo-random chance that each of their rating is either good, bad or average. The process governing the assignment of a first rating being good, medium or bad can be arguably considered as a random assignment.
                	</p>

                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
						&emsp;&emsp; Now to understand its importance and why it is such a great news that our study could be considered as a “Natural Experiment”, let’s take a counter example: <strong>A famous tobacco company</strong>, after selling for many years deadly products, felt bad about what they did and developed a new chewing gum solution that could help people to quit smoking. They wanted to try their new solution to be able to show to the world its great results. For that they designed an experiment in which they compared their new chewing gum with a competitor’s patch solution. In order to do so, they gathered 200 smokers: sampled such that 100 consumers want to quit and therefore will try the chewing gum solution while the hundred others didn't show any interest in stopping and were chosen to try the competitor's solution and to later compare to the first group. For a few weeks the 100 first participants took the chewing gum while the other 100 took the patch solution.

                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
					At the end of the experiment, the tobacco company comes with their results. They found out that only 10 participants out of 100 in the first group smoke one or more cigarettes during the whole experiment while in the second group 90 participants out of 100 smoked. By comparing the 2 groups they declared to have obtained outstanding results proving that their product is 9 times more effective than what the competition proposes. Now if we think about it, are those results really trustworthy or did the design of the experiment completely bias its results ? 
					</p>

                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
						Well as you may have already guessed, the <strong>results are completely biased</strong> by the subject selection process in this case. The smoking company chose, for testing its product, participants that already wanted to quit smoking. Those had from the beginning a higher probability of quitting than those that showed zero interest in doing so. In a “natural experiment”, the selection of participants would have been determined by nature hence be randomised or at least outside the control of the experiment. So a “natural experiment” would have led to more meaningful results and would have guaranteed that the study has not been influenced by subject selection or category assignment. This is what we are happy to have here in this study.
                	</p>

                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
                		It might still be unclear to you how do we plan to have a natural experiment in our investigation. Well as explained previously, books come in different formats. For example think about a book that is proposed in both paperback, hardcover and e-book or even the same book that was published by different companies. Then we will have the same content but different reviews. If we succeed to find two books that are similar then nature will have decided on which reviews each of them will have received and this independently of our project. We will have in such setup two identical book (at least in term of content) and different initial reviews, which is exactly what we need.

						<h3>1. Too many books</h3>
	                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
	                		&emsp;&emsp; Unfortunately, we are working on a very large dataset. We started our project by discarding the books for which we didn’t have enough reviews to study the Herding Effect later on. But this step left us with approximately 625’682 books. And this is quite problematic, let’s consider that we would like to match books based only on their titles. We would need to compare them pairwisely and to check how similar they are. 
	                	</p>
	                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
							A popular way to compare the similarity of two strings is to use a Mathematical measure called Jaccard Similarity, to put it simply it represents the number of words that are common between the two strings divided by the size of the dictionary used by the two strings. If we had to compute this similarity over all those books we would need to compute it <strong>195,738,669,721 times</strong>. While this number might not be very tangible, the time it takes to compute clearly is : it represents more than <strong>655 days, that is a bit less than 2 years</strong> to run on a consumer grade computer. 
	                	</p>
	                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
							The goal of the project was to be done in less than a month and therefore this was (slightly) concerning.

					<h3>2. The power of Hashing</h3>
                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
                		&emsp;&emsp; We needed to derive a strategy to be able to compare so many books. We used a technique called <strong>Locality sensitive hashing</strong>. The scope of this article isn’t to example the fascinating maths behind the tools used for the analysis but more to give a high level understanding of our experimental protocol, therefore we will try to highly vulgarize it. 
                	</p>
                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
                		Suppose that we could color a title based only on the words it contains. Each letter would be associated with a color, a word would have the same color than the mix of colors from its characters, and then a sentence would be itself associated with the mix of colors from the words it contains. Then it would be very likely that two titles with the same color would be similar. 
                	</p>
                	<p class="title-sub text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
                		Locality sensitive hashing works like a coloring scheme. It assigns to each title a given value, the probability that this value is the same for two titles is very high if the titles are similar. Therefore we only need to compute this value for each title and to then compare using any method we want only the titles that have the same value.

				<div class="col-md-12">
                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
                		Now let’s talk running time, in order to compute this value for each title it takes about <strong>1 minute and 30 seconds</strong> and it yields 14,524 groups of books that are possibly similars. Those groups span over less than 35,742 books. We have successfully reduced the size of our dataset while keeping all the books that have at least one similar product.

					<h3>3. Refining our results using an external API</h3>
                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
                		&emsp;&emsp; Once we have significantly reduced the number of books that we work on it is time to check whether or not those candidate similars are indeed similar or not. In order to achieve such goal we needed to obtain more details concerning each book. The original dataset was particularly poor regarding products metadatas. We didn’t have much information on the books and we therefore decided to use Amazon Product advertising API to obtain such information. Once this was done we obtained strategic details : authors, publisher, ISBN, binding and edition.

                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
                		Using those we compared each book in the similar books from last step using the authors list of the books. We didn’t want to be too restrictive on the authors because two similar books A and B might not have the exact same authors list for numerous reasons:
	                	<br>
	                	<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;  - one of the authors was forgotten in one of the authors’ list
						<br>
						&emsp;&emsp;  - an authors name contained a typo
						<br>
						<br>
						Hence we had to again think of a strategy. The two lists of authors might have different lengths. We started to “clean” those lists by removing the accents and putting the name to lower cases.
						<br>
						<br>
						Then we used what is called the relative <strong>Levenstein distance</strong>. This metric compute the proportion of the longuest string’s charachters that we have to modify (or delete) in order to obtain the shortest one.

                		&emsp;&emsp; Once we have significantly reduced the number of books that we work on it is time to check whether or not those candidate similars are indeed similar or not. In order to achieve such goal we needed to obtain more details concerning each book. The original dataset was particularly poor regarding products metadatas. We didn’t have much information on the books and we therefore decided to use Amazon Product advertising API to obtain such information. Once this was done we obtained strategic details : authors, publisher, ISBN, binding and edition.

        	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
        		&emsp;&emsp; After matching and gathering many pairs of very similar books and in order to study the effect of a first review over the next ones, a step we had to realise was to find out what was the rating of the first review for each book (Amazon possible ratings are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). From that first rating we had to determine a way to be able to put each book into a specific category. Having categories such has high first review or low first review allows us to <strong>separate our data into different groups</strong> that, we will then be able to compare throughout the study. Two decisions were made  establish the different categories we were willing to use. First we had to decide how many categories we wanted. Deciding the number of categories was simply a trade-off between high number of categories to confirm our results with low numbers of books inside them (low reliability of each category) and low number of categories to confirm our results but high number of books inside each (high reliability of each category). We settled for three categories as follows: 
        	</p>

        		<div class="col-md-4 text-center">

        	<p class="title-sub text-justify" style="margin-top: 20px;">
        		Now it is good to know which categories we want but the second decision we had to face was: which books are we going to put into which category. To answer that question we simply looked at the repartition of the first ratings we had among all the books. 
        	</p>

        			<p class="title-sub text-justify" style="margin-top: 20px;">
        				We saw that it was not going to be easy to have balanced categories as an important part of the books received 5 star ratings. Nevertheless the most balanced we could come up with was to consider low ratings to be ratings with at most 3 stars and medium ratings those with 4 stars. And therefore obtained:

				&emsp;&emsp; What is interesting in our analysis is to study a pair of very similar books and compare for that specific pair of books what are the ratings after a high first rating compared to the ratings after a low first rating. To do so and once we were able to categorise each book according to their first rating among our 3 categories (high, medium or low), we wanted to spot which pair of books had a book starting with a high first review with another starting with a low first review to be able to compare the following ratings. That is where we created 6 groups of pairs of similar books and then compared each group. The groups were as follows:

				&emsp;&emsp; All these different groups allowed us to study and confirm the effect of a first review on a book being high, low or medium. The most interesting and promising group is probably the HL group as it is the one where we are supposed to observe a lot of difference between successive ratings as the first rating is very different for each pair of similar books. Other groups such as HH, MM, LL are more here just to confirm our results from the HL group as there is supposed to be no difference in the following ratings on these groups since they start with already a very similar rating. Let’s see if we can confirm these hypotheses with our results in the next part of this study.
