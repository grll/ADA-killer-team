                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
                		&emsp;&emsp; Fortunately for us, in this study we have encountered what we call a “Natural Experiment”. A Natural Experiment in our case, refers simply to the fact that each subject/element concerned by this analysis (the pair of similar books for instance) have a specific first rating and that this first rating is <strong>determined by nature</strong> or by other factors outside the control of this study. We have indeed for each pair of similar books a pseudo random chance that their first rating are both good, or good and bad, or medium and good.  The process governing the assignment of a first rating being good, medium or bad can be arguably considered as a random assignment.

						&emsp;&emsp; Now to understand the importance of it and why this is such a great news that our study could be considered as a “Natural Experiment”, let’s take a counter example: <strong>A famous tobacco company</strong>, after selling for many year deadly products, felt bad about what they did and developed a new chewing gum solution that could help people to quit smoking. They want to try their new solution to be able to show to the world their great results and for that they design an experiment in which they compare their new chewing gum with a competitor’s patch solution. In order to do so, they gathered 200 smoking participants: a first group of 100 of these participant wants to quit smoking and they will be trying out the chewing gum while the remaining 100 participants didn’t show any interest in quitting smoking. Therefore, they will be trying the patch solution from the competitor and they will be used to compare the result with the first group at the end of the experiment. For a few weeks the 100 first participant take the chewing gum while the other 100 take the patch solution.

                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
					At the end of the experiment, the tobacco company comes with their results. They found out that only 10 participants out of 100 in the first group smoke one or more cigarettes during the whole experiment while in the second group 90 participants out of 100 smoked. By comparing the 2 groups they say the results are amazing and the effectiveness of their product is 9 times more effective than competitor’s patch solution. Now if we think about it, are those results really trustworthy or did the design of the experiment completely bias the experiment and its results ? 
					</p>

                	<p class="title-sub text-justify">
						Well as you may have already guessed, the <strong>results are completely biased</strong> by the subject selection process in this case. The smoking company choose for testing it’s product participant that already wanted to quit smoking they had from the beginning a higher probability of stoping no matter what treatment they used. In a “natural experiment”, the selection of the participant would have been determined by nature hence be randomised or at least outside the control of the experiment. So a “natural experiment” would have led to more meaningful results and would have guarantee that the study has not been influenced by subject selection or category assignment. This is what we are happy to have here in this study.

                	<p class="title-sub">
                		After matching and gathering many pairs of very similar books and in order to study the effect of a first review over the next ones, a step we had to realise was to find out what was the rating of the first review for each books (amazon possible ratings are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). From that first rating we had to determine a way to be able to put each book into a specific category. Having categories such has high first review or low first review allows us to separate our data into different groups that we will be then able to compare throughout the study. Two decision were made to establish the different categories we were willing to use. First we had to decide how many categories we wanted. Deciding the number of category was simply a trade-off between high number of categories to confirm our results with low number of books inside of them (low reliability of each category) and low number of categories to confirm our results but high number of books inside of them (high reliability of each category). We settled for three categories: books with high first review (H), books with medium first review (M) and finally, books with low first review (L).  Now it is good to know which categories we want but the second decision we had to face was which books are we going to put into which category. To answer that question we simply looked at the repartition of the first ratings we had among every books. We saw that most of the books started with a 5 star rating, then an also big proportion started with a 4 stars while we had very low number of books starting with 1, 2 or 3 stars rating. To balance our categories and have enough books in each category (increasing the number of books of each category increases its reliability)  we decided to put books with a 5 star first rating in the first category (high first review), the books with a 4 star first rating  in the second category (medium first review), finally the books with a first rating between 1 and 3 in the last category (low first review).
                	</p>
                	<p class="title-sub">
						What is interesting in our analysis is to study a pair of very similar books and compare for that specific pair of book what are the ratings after a high first rating compared to the ratings after a low first rating. To do so and once we were able to categorise each book according to their first rating among our 3 categories (high, medium or low), we wanted to spot which pair of books had a book starting with a high first review with another starting with a low first review to be able to compare the following ratings. That is were we created 6 groups of pair of similar books and then compared each group. The groups were as follow: HH for pair of  books both starting with high first rating, MM for pair of  books both starting with medium first rating, LL for pair of 2 books both starting with low first rating, HL for pair of books starting with high and low first rating, HM for pair of books starting with high and medium first rating and ML fir pair of books starting with medium and low first rating. All this different groups allowed us to study and confirm the effect of a first review on a book being high, low or medium. The most interesting and promising group is probably the HL group as it the one where we are supposed to observe a lot of difference between successive ratings as the first rating is very different for each pair of similar books. Other groups such as HH, MM, LL are more here just to confirm our results from the HL group as there is supposed to be no difference in the following ratings on these groups since they start with already a very similar rating. Let’s see if we can confirm these hypotheses with our results in the next part of this study.
